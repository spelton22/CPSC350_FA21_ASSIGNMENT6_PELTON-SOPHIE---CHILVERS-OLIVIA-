4. #2 prints out only the information of the faculty and not their advisees; We did this to focus only on the faculty details and less clutter
  #4 prints out the faculty information and the IDs of the advisees; We did this to prevent clutter of all the studentâ€™s individual info
  #10 wont let the user delete a faculty member if it is the last one; We did this since it would not make sense for the students to have no advisors
  #12 reassigns the removed advisee to a new advisor if there exists another advisor; If not, the advisee stays with the advisor
